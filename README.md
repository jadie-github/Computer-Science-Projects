1. Huffman Coding (java) (WATCH THE FILE HUFFMANCODE.MP4 FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING)

Project description: Huffman coding is an algorithm devised by David A. Huffman of MIT in 1952 for compressing data to
make a file occupy a smaller amount of space. In this assignment, I create classes HuffmanCode and HuffmanNode to be used in 
compression of data. A file HuffmanCompressor.java will handle user interaction and calls
the huffman code methods to compress and decompress a given file. The users will be able to: pass a text file (.txt) to make a compressed huffman code file (.code), compress that file into (.short), decompress that file into a (.new) file, initialize a huffman code by using an array of different frequencies representing counts of characters in a text, and 
construct a huffman code by reading a given input (.code) file.

2. Image Modifier (C++) 

Project Description: A digital image is composed of a two-dimensional array of pixels. If the images has r rows and c columns, then there are r*c pixels in the image. Each pixel has a location and value. The location is given by the row and column of the pixel. 
In RGB imaging (red, green, blue), each pixel in a color image has three intensities, one for red, one for green, and one for blue (these are the primary colors of light). Three bytes (0 to 255) are used for each pixel in a color image. Images take values (call the intensity) from 0 to 255 (1 byte = 8 bits of information). 0 is the darkest black and 255 is the brightest white.

3. 20 Questions (java)

Project Description: 20 Questions is a guessing game in which the objective is to ask yes/no questions to determine an object. In my version, the human begins a round by choosing some object, and the computer attempts to guess that object by asking a series of yes/no questions until it thinks it knows the answer. Then, the computer makes a guess; if its guess is correct, the computer wins, and otherwise the user wins. If the computer loses, it will add the object that the user was thinking of to its knowledge base.

4. CREATE FRACTAL IMAGE (C++)

Project Description: This project performs a recursive
fractal operation on an input GIF image. The driver class reads in a GIF image file and creates a new GIF image
that consists of a smaller-sized version of the original image on the upper left orner, a smaller-sized flipped version
of the original image on the bottom right corner, and uses the same pattern to draw to the remaining upper right and lower left
corners of the image until there is no more space (pixels) to be allocated.

5. CREATE IMAGE FILTER (C++)

Project Description: This program takes in a GIF input image, finds segments of the image where there are similar colors, 
groups similar pixels together to create a more "toned down" version of the image with less colors. This can be used as a filter
for pictures on applications like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, etc.

6. IMAGE MIRROR

Project Description:  This program reads in an input GIF image, then flips (mirrors) the image 
and outputs the result image file to a new file "output.gif".

7. Letter Inventory (java)

Project Description: This project used to keep track of an inventory of letters of the alphabet.  The constructor for the class 
takes a String and computes how many of each letter are in the String.  This is the information the object keeps track of 
(how many a’s, how many b’s, etc).  It ignores the case of the letters and ignores anything that is not an alphabetic character 
(e.g., it ignores punctuation characters, digits and anything else that is not a letter).

8. Guitar Hero (java)

Project Description: This project mimics a guitar with only 37 pitches. Users can play notes on their keyboards 
with the notes corresponding to a key mapping input (see string.txt). Users can also choose song samples for the program to read and play out.
The song samples need to be in .txt form, and each letter has to correspond to a note in the key mapping.

GuitarHero.java is the main program to play all the notes. GuitarLite.java is a mini version of GuitarHero.java where you can only 
play 2 notes (pressing A and C on the keyboard). If you want to play a pre-written song, use PlayThatTune.java, and select a .txt file 
from the "Tunes" folder. To record your playing, use RecordThatTune.java.

Have fun riffing!

9.Playing Assassin (java)

Project Description: This program helps you manage a game of assassin. Each person playing assassin has a particular target that 
they are trying to assassinate.  One of the things that makes the game more interesting to play is that initially each person knows 
only who they are assassinating (they don't know who is trying to assassinate them nor do they know who other people are trying to 
assassinate).  You are working on a program for the “game administrator” who needs to keep track of who is stalking whom and the 
history of who killed whom.

Happy hunting!

10. Evil Hangman Game (java) 

Project Description: This program mimics a game of hangman.  But this won’t be any ordinary game of hangman.  Our hangman program is going to cheat. In a normal game of hangman, the computer picks a word that the user is supposed to guess.  In our game of hangman, the computer is going to delay picking a word until it is forced to.  As a result, at any given point in time there will be a set of words that are currently being used by the computer.  Each of those words will have the same pattern to be displayed to the user. This way, the user will lose faster, and definitely won't win most of the time.

11. Random Grammar Generator (java)

Project Description: this program reads an input file with a grammar in Backus-Naur Form (BNF) and allows the user to 
randomly generate elements of the grammar.

12. Anagram Solver (java)

Project Description: This project uses a dictionary to find all combinations of words that have the
same letters as a given phrase.

13. Binary Number Calculator (c++)

Project Description: The main part of this assignment is to create a class called Binary implementing an abstract data type for binary numbers of arbitrary length (no limit to the number of bits). 

14. Binary Search Tree Letter Processor (c++)

Project Description: In this program, I implement a binary search tree that sorts letters in a text file and implement letter operations.

15. Djikstra’s Algorithm (c++)
Project Description: In this program, I implement Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths using an adjacency list representation.

16. Inventory Shop / Collectibles store simulation (c++)

Project Description: A local collectibles store wishes to automate their inventory tracking system. I implement a program that represents a tracking system for all the items, transaction histories, and customer information.
