Abstract data types - trees, priority queues, graphs, heaps, and tables
Object-oriented programming and design, including inheritance and polymorphism
Modeling computation - regular expressions, finite state machines, context-free grammars, and Turing machines
Algorithm development and analysis - Huffman's algorithm, Dijkstra's algorithm, etc.
