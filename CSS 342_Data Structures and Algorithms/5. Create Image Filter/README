CREATE IMAGE FILTER (C++)

Project Description: This program takes in a GIF input image, finds segments of the image where there are similar colors, 
groups similar pixels together to create a more "toned down" version of the image with less colors. This can be used as a filter
for pictures on applications like Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, etc.

This program uses methods from the Container and Image classes.

See test4.GIF for an example input image and output.GIF for the result.
