CREATE FRACTAL IMAGE (C++)

Project Description: This project performs a recursive fractal operation on an input GIF image. The driver class reads in a GIF image file 
and creates a new GIF image that consists of a smaller-sized version of the original image on the upper left orner, a smaller-sized 
flipped version of the original image on the bottom right corner, and uses the same pattern to draw to the remaining upper right and lower 
left corners of the image until there is no more space (pixels) to be allocated.

This program uses methods from the Image and Rectangle classes.

See test3.GIF to see the example input and output.GIF to see the result.
