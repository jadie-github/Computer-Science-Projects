Guitar Hero (java)

Project Description: This project mimics a guitar with only 37 pitches. Users can play notes on their keyboards 
with the notes corresponding to a key mapping input (see string.txt). Users can also choose song samples for the program to read and play out.
The song samples need to be in .txt form, and each letter has to correspond to a note in the key mapping.

GuitarHero.java is the main program to play all the notes. GuitarLite.java is a mini version of GuitarHero.java where you can only 
play 2 notes (pressing A and C on the keyboard). If you want to play a pre-written song, use PlayThatTune.java, and select a .txt file 
from the "Tunes" folder. To record your playing, use RecordThatTune.java.

Use Test37.java to test the program.

Have fun riffing!
