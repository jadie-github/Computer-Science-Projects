Evil Hangman Game (java) 

Project Description: This program mimics a game of hangman.  But this wonâ€™t be any ordinary game of hangman.  
Our hangman program is going to cheat. In a normal game of hangman, the computer picks a word that the user is supposed to guess.  
In our game of hangman, the computer is going to delay picking a word until it is forced to.  As a result, at any given point in time 
there will be a set of words that are currently being used by the computer.  Each of those words will have the same pattern to be 
displayed to the user. This way, the user will lose faster, and definitely won't win most of the time.

Use dictionary.txt for a full list of vocab. Use dictionary2.txt for a mini version of the vocabs.

Happy guessing (incorrectly)!
