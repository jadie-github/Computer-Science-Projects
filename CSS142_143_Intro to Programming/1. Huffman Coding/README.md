 Huffman Coding (java) (WATCH THE FILE HUFFMANCODE.MP4 FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING)

Project Description: Huffman coding is an algorithm devised by David A. Huffman of MIT in 1952 for compressing data to
make a file occupy a smaller amount of space. In this assignment, I create classes HuffmanCode and HuffmanNode to be used in 
compression of data. A file HuffmanCompressor.java will handle user interaction and calls
the huffman code methods to compress and decompress a given file. The users will be able to: pass a text file (.txt) to make a compressed huffman code file (.code), compress that file into (.short), decompress that file into a (.new) file, initialize a huffman code by using an array of different frequencies representing counts of characters in a text, and 
construct a huffman code by reading a given input (.code) file.
