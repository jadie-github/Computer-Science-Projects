Playing Assassin (java)

Project Description: This program helps you manage a game of assassin. Each person playing assassin has a particular target that 
they are trying to assassinate.  One of the things that makes the game more interesting to play is that initially each person knows 
only who they are assassinating (they don't know who is trying to assassinate them nor do they know who other people are trying to 
assassinate).  You are working on a program for the “game administrator” who needs to keep track of who is stalking whom and the 
history of who killed whom.

Use names.txt, names1.txt,names2.txt, or names3.txt to choose the characters in this game. You can also make your own list of names.

Happy hunting!
